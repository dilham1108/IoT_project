# Predictive Maintenance System with Vibration and Temperature Sensors

## Description
This project implements a predictive maintenance system using IoT and industrial-grade sensors. It monitors machine conditions such as vibration and temperature to predict potential failures, optimizing maintenance schedules and reducing downtime in industrial settings.

## Technologies Used
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32
- **Industrial Sensors:**
  - Vibration Sensor: IMI Sensors (e.g., 682A series)
  - Temperature Sensor: PT100 or PT1000 RTD sensor
- **Platform Cloud:** Google Cloud IoT
- **Programming Languages:** Python, C++
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn

## Project Steps

### Hardware Setup
- Connect industrial sensors (vibration and temperature) to the ESP32 microcontroller.
- Ensure sensors are calibrated and provide accurate readings.

### Data Collection
- Develop code to read vibration and temperature data from industrial sensors using the ESP32.
- Implement sampling rates and data logging mechanisms to capture sufficient data points for analysis.

### Data Transmission
- Set up communication protocols (e.g., MQTT) for secure transmission of sensor data to Google Cloud IoT.
- Implement error handling and data integrity checks during transmission.

### Cloud Integration
- Create a Google Cloud IoT Core project and register the ESP32 device.
- Develop code to publish vibration and temperature data to Google Cloud IoT Core using MQTT.
- Configure Google Cloud Pub/Sub for data ingestion and processing.

### Data Storage and Processing
- Store sensor data in Google Cloud Storage or a database (e.g., Google Cloud Firestore).
- Utilize Google Cloud Functions or Dataflow for real-time data processing, feature extraction, and analysis.

### Machine Learning Model Development
- Prepare labeled datasets using historical sensor data and maintenance records.
- Choose suitable machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) for predictive maintenance.
- Train the model to predict machine failures based on vibration patterns and temperature fluctuations.

### Model Deployment
- Deploy the trained machine learning model on Google Cloud AI Platform or as a custom prediction service.
- Integrate the model with the real-time data pipeline to generate predictions and anomaly alerts.

### Alerts and Notifications
- Implement a notification system to alert maintenance personnel or system administrators about predicted failures or abnormal sensor readings.
- Configure thresholds and rules for triggering alerts based on machine condition assessments.

### Dashboard and Visualization
- Develop a web-based dashboard using Google Data Studio or Grafana to visualize sensor data trends, predictions, and maintenance alerts.
- Provide interactive features for exploring historical data, monitoring machine health status, and adjusting maintenance schedules.

### Documentation and Testing
- Create comprehensive documentation including project overview, setup instructions, and API references.
- Conduct rigorous testing of the entire system, encompassing hardware, software, and cloud components.
- Document troubleshooting steps and resolutions for common issues encountered during deployment.
